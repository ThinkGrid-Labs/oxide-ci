# Configuration File (.greengate.toml)

Place `.greengate.toml` in the root of your repository. CLI flags always override config file values. All fields are optional — omitted values fall back to built-in defaults.

## Precedence

CLI flag > `--profile` override > `.greengate.toml` > built-in default

## Profiles

Apply a named quality profile on top of your loaded config with the global `--profile` flag:

```bash
greengate --profile strict scan
greengate --profile ci scan --staged
```

| Profile | Effect |
|---|---|
| `strict` | Coverage ≥ 90%, entropy threshold 3.5 (more sensitive), Lighthouse performance ≥ 90, accessibility ≥ 95, SAST enabled |
| `relaxed` | Coverage ≥ 70%, entropy threshold 5.0 (fewer false positives) |
| `ci` | Coverage ≥ 80%, SAST enabled, code-smell rules (`SMELL/*`) disabled to reduce noise |

Profiles modify the in-memory config only — they never write to `.greengate.toml`.

## Inline suppression

Suppress a finding on a specific line using a comment:

```ts
const key = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE123"; // greengate: ignore
el.innerHTML = sanitizedHtml;           // greengate: ignore
```

Works for both secret/PII and SAST findings.
