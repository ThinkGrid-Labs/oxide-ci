# Limitations

This page documents the known boundaries of GreenGate's analysis. Understanding these limitations helps you set accurate expectations and decide where additional tooling may be warranted.

## SAST — taint tracking scope

GreenGate implements **Tier-1 intra-procedural taint tracking** for JS/TS. This means:

### What IS covered

| Scenario | Example |
|---|---|
| Direct source → sink (same statement) | `el.innerHTML = req.body.html` |
| Single-hop variable assignment | `const x = req.body.data; el.innerHTML = x` |
| Template literal propagation | `` const h = `<b>${x}</b>`; el.innerHTML = h `` |
| String concatenation propagation | `const cmd = "ls " + x; exec(cmd)` |
| Member access on tainted object | `const id = req.params.id; exec("cmd " + id)` |
| Sanitizer-through-variable suppression | `const s = DOMPurify.sanitize(x); el.innerHTML = s` |
| Static variable suppression | `const label = "Hello"; el.innerHTML = label` |

### What is NOT covered (Tier 2 / Tier 3)

| Gap | Reason | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| **Inter-procedural taint** — taint flowing through a user-defined function call | Requires building a call graph across functions, which is Tier 2 | Add `// greengate: ignore` on the call site, or use a purpose-built SAST tool (Semgrep, Snyk Code) for this pattern |
| **Cross-file taint** — taint flowing through `import`/`require` across modules | Requires a whole-project analysis pass; not practical in a single-file scanner | Same as above |
| **Object/array destructuring propagation** | `const { name } = req.body` — destructured properties are not yet tracked | Assign to an intermediate variable before the sink |
| **Conditional taint** — value is tainted only on certain branches | Flow-sensitive analysis (not implemented) | Unlikely to matter in practice for most XSS/injection sinks |
| **Prototype chain / dynamic dispatch** | `this.input` or `obj[key]` | Use explicit variable assignments |

### Practical false negative risk

Because Tier-2 (inter-procedural) taint is not tracked, a pattern like:

```js
function getInput() {
  return req.body.data;   // taint source inside a helper
}

el.innerHTML = getInput();  // greengate sees an unknown call — flags normally
```

…is **still flagged** at normal confidence because GreenGate does not know `getInput()` is safe. The false negative scenario is the opposite: a sanitizer wrapped in a function will NOT suppress the finding:

```js
function safeHtml(input) {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(input);  // safe inside function
}

el.innerHTML = safeHtml(raw);  // greengate does not know safeHtml() is safe
                               // → flagged (false positive)
```

For this case, use `// greengate: ignore` on the assignment line, or add `safeHtml` to a custom-safe list via a custom SAST rule.

## SAST — language coverage

| Language | AST-based SAST | Taint tracking | Code smells |
|---|---|---|---|
| JavaScript (`.js`, `.jsx`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Python (`.py`) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Go (`.go`) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, Rust | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

Python and Go SAST uses pattern-only matching (no taint tracking). Taint tracking is JS/TS only.

## SAST — no TypeScript type information

GreenGate uses [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) for AST parsing. tree-sitter is a syntax parser — it does **not** have access to TypeScript's type checker. This means:

- The engine cannot know the declared type of a variable (e.g. it cannot tell whether a `string` came from `HTMLElement.innerHTML` or a user-defined getter).
- Generic suppression decisions (is this `exec()` a child_process call or a DB query builder call?) are made by inspecting the receiver's **name** and AST shape, not its type.

For higher-fidelity type-aware analysis, Semgrep Pro or a dedicated type-aware linter would be needed.

## Dependency audit — OSV API dependency

`greengate audit` queries the [OSV database](https://osv.dev). In environments without outbound internet access:

- Audit results are cached locally for **24 hours** (offline-friendly for most CI scenarios).
- If the cache is stale and the network is unavailable, `greengate audit` exits with a warning rather than a hard failure, so it does not break air-gapped builds.

`ignore_advisories` in `.greengate.toml` suppresses specific GHSA/CVE IDs without disabling the audit entirely. See the [audit command docs](/commands/audit) for details.

---

## Secret scanning — entropy tuning

Shannon entropy detection (`entropy = true`) may produce false positives on:

- **Lock file integrity hashes** (e.g. `pnpm-lock.yaml` sha512 checksums) — add `"pnpm-lock.yaml"` to `exclude_patterns`.
- **Base64-encoded binary assets** embedded in source (SVGs, fonts) — exclude `**/public/**` or the specific asset directory.
- **Minified JavaScript** — exclude `**/*.min.js`.

Raising `entropy_threshold` (e.g. to `5.0`) reduces false positives but may miss shorter secrets. Lowering it (e.g. to `3.5`) via `--profile strict` increases sensitivity.

---

## Baseline mode

`--since-baseline` compares findings against `.greengate-baseline.json`. Findings are matched by **file path + rule ID + line number**. If a secret moves to a different line (e.g. after a rebase or auto-formatter pass), it will re-appear as a new finding. Commit `.greengate-baseline.json` to version control and regenerate it with `--update-baseline` whenever baseline findings are intentionally resolved.

---

## No inter-process or runtime analysis

GreenGate is a **static** analysis tool. It cannot:

- Detect secrets injected at runtime via environment variables (those are generally safe — use env vars instead of hardcoding).
- Detect vulnerabilities that only manifest under specific runtime conditions (race conditions, logic bugs, SSRF depending on user-controlled URLs at runtime).
- Replace dynamic analysis tools (DAST, fuzzing, penetration testing).
